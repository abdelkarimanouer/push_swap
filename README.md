*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by aanouer.*

## Description
The push_swap project is an algorithmic challenge that consists of sorting a list of integers using two stacks (stack a and stack b) and a limited set of operations.  
The goal is to produce the smallest possible sequence of operations that sorts the data in ascending order.  
The project focuses on algorithm design, optimization, and respecting strict constraints.

## Instructions
